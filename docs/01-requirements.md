# Requirements

The contents of the "infra-tests" directory is unchanged, and can run green as a step in your CI workflow. Anything else can be modified, given the requirements detailed here and in the "Submit your solution" section are still fulfilled.

For configuration management you have to use Ansible, and for coding/scripting you must use either bash/zsh or the Python version installed on the macOS CI machine.

## Scoring

In this situation, we prefer solutions that the candidate has written themselves or can explain completely.
