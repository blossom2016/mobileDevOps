# Setup

## Code repository

Before any work is done, on [Github.com](https://github.com/) create a Private git repository, and share it with [peterheja-bitrise](https://github.com/peterheja-bitrise) and [bitrise-infrabot](https://github.com/bitrise-infrabot) users.

After this, upload the `.zip` file we've provided with the codebase.

## app.bitrise.io

You have to have an [app.bitrise.io](https://app.bitrise.io/) user and set up an app with this repository.

You have to share this app with [peter.heja@bitrise.io](peter.heja@bitrise.io), which can be achieved by going to the App Settings, Teams, People and Add Contributor. Role should be Admin.

**Important: Share the username with us early on and we will provide extra credits on the platform, because the free tier credits might run out while developing. Fitting into these credits is not part of the challenge.**
